# NixOS-Configuration
My personal NixOS-Configuration, including public key.

My intent here is to build a reliable way to deploy my workstation using NixOS, with the hope this may later be expandable to other technological integrations.
In an ideal scenario this repository will eventually allow me to deploy to any hardware, with my expected environment.
