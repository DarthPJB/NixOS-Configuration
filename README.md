# NixOS-Configuration
My personal NixOS-Configuration, including public keys.

My intent here is to build a reliable way to deploy my workstation, and surrounding homelab (and further surrounding infrastructure) using NixOS, with the hope this may later be expandable to other technological integrations.
This repository now allows me to deploy to any hardware, with my expected environment.

TODO:
- Configure IPv6 forwarding
- Address hard-coded IP security
- Document Nixinate usage
- Implement LDAP authentication
- Automate scraper configuration
- Optimize storage
- Decide DNS vs WG-IP connectivity
- Expand filesystem support
- Implement GPG-based SSH authentication
- Continue library-splitting efforts
- STANDARDIZE KNOWNHOSTS FROM PUBLIC KEYs ;)
