# NixOS-Configuration
My personal NixOS-Configuration, including public keys.

My intent here is to build a reliable way to deploy my workstation, and surrounding homelab (and further surrounding infrastructure) using NixOS, with the hope this may later be expandable to other technological integrations.
This repository now allows me to deploy to any hardware, with my expected environment.
