{"path": "server_services/syncthing_server.nix", "analysis": "This module sets up Syncthing for decentralized file synchronization across devices, with S3-backed storage mount, custom configuration for folders and devices, and systemd service for mounting the NAS directory. It configures multiple sync folders, devices, and GUI access with authentication. Notes: Syncthing GUI on 0.0.0.0:8384 with theme and password. Devices include local-nas and remote-worker-2. Folders for obsidian-archive, NAS-ARCHIVE, Camera, and default, all synced with specified devices. Data and config dirs on /futureNAS. Firewall allows sync and discovery ports. Systemd service mounts S3 bucket to /futureNAS using s3fs. Reasoning: Syncthing enables peer-to-peer file syncing without central server, ideal for distributed backups and collaboration. S3 mount provides scalable storage. Multiple folders organize different data types. This creates a resilient, distributed storage system for the homelab, with automatic syncing and backup across machines."}
