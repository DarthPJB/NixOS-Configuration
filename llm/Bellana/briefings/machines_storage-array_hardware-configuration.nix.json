{"path": "machines/storage-array/hardware-configuration.nix", "sanitized_path": "machines_storage-array_hardware-configuration.nix.json", "notes": "This auto-generated NixOS hardware configuration file defines boot parameters, kernel modules, and file systems for the storage-array machine. It includes modules for AHCI, USB, MegaRAID SAS, and others; kernel modules for KVM-Intel. File systems mount ZFS pools for root (tmpfs), /ARCHIVE, /nix, /var/log, /tmp, /etc/ssh, /etc/nixos, and /boot as VFAT. A swap device is specified. Networking defaults to DHCP, platform is x86_64-linux with Intel microcode updates.", "reasoning": "As a generated file, it encapsulates hardware-specific settings detected by nixos-generate-config, ensuring compatibility with the system's RAID controller, ZFS setup, and EFI boot. The tmpfs root and ZFS mounts indicate a diskless or minimal disk setup relying on network storage, with KVM modules suggesting virtualization capabilities."}
