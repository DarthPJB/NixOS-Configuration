{"path": "modifier_imports/central-builder.nix", "sanitized_path": "modifier_imports_central-builder.nix.json", "notes": "This module configures Nix for distributed builds using a central builder machine named 'LINDA' at IP 10.88.127.88. It sets up SSH access for the 'build' user with a secret key via Secrix, defines build machine parameters including max jobs (50), speed factor (5), supported features (big-parallel, kvm, nixos-test, benchmark), and enables distributed builds with substitutes. SSH known hosts are configured for LINDA.", "reasoning": "The configuration enables offloading Nix package builds to a high-performance remote server, reducing local build times. Secrix manages the SSH key securely, while the build machine settings optimize for parallel and KVM-accelerated builds. This is a common setup for NixOS infrastructures with dedicated build hosts."}
