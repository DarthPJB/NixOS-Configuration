IPFS represents a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to create a permanent, decentralized web. By enabling services.kubo, the system becomes a node in the IPFS network, capable of storing, retrieving, and distributing content addressed by cryptographic hashes rather than location-based addresses. The configuration is minimal, relying on NixOS's default Kubo service settings, which typically include automatic startup, default ports (4001 for swarm, 8080 for gateway), and standard data directory setup. This enables the system to participate in the global IPFS network, providing resilient content delivery and potentially serving as a gateway for other devices on the local network. The implementation reflects the growing adoption of decentralized technologies in system configuration."}
