{"path": "machines/remote-builder/default.nix", "sanitized_path": "machines_remote-builder_default.nix.json", "notes": "This configuration sets up a NixOS machine as a dedicated remote builder for distributed Nix builds. It imports base configurations including core system settings, user management for 'darthpjb', flake support, SSH daemon, development tools, dynamic DNS updates via Gandi, GitHub Actions runners, build user setup, and WireGuard VPN enablement. The hostname is set to 'remote-builder', with VPN connectivity using a postfix of 51 and secrets managed via Secrix.", "reasoning": "The module integrates multiple environment and service imports to create a build-optimized server, emphasizing remote access, CI/CD capabilities, and secure networking. The use of WireGuard ensures encrypted communication within the VPN network, while dynamic DNS allows for reliable external access. This setup facilitates offloading computationally intensive builds to this machine from other NixOS systems."}
