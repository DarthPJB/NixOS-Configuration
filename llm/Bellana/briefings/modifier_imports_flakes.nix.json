{"filename": "modifier_imports/flakes.nix", "path": "modifier_imports/flakes.nix", "function_summary": "Enables Nix Flakes experimental feature.", "detailed_notes": "This minimal NixOS module activates the 'flakes' experimental feature in Nix settings. Flakes represent a significant evolution in Nix package management, introducing hermetic, reproducible, and composable units of code that can be used across different contexts. By enabling this feature, the system gains access to modern Nix functionality including improved dependency management, better caching, and enhanced reproducibility. The configuration is straightforward, directly modifying nix.settings.experimental-features to include 'flakes'. This enables users to leverage flake-based workflows for system configuration, package development, and deployment, which is crucial in contemporary Nix ecosystems. The module serves as a foundational enablement for advanced Nix features while maintaining backward compatibility."}
