{"path": "server_services/samba_server.nix", "analysis": "This module configures Samba file sharing server with Windows service discovery (WSDD), user-level security, and a public share accessible to guests. It sets up firewall rules for WSDD ports and defines share permissions with masks and user mappings. Notes: WSDD enabled for Windows client discovery on ports 5357 TCP and 3702 UDP. Samba enabled with user security, bound to virbr0 interface, workgroup WORKGROUP. Public share at /bulk-storage/public-share with guest access, create/directory masks, and forced user/group. Reasoning: Samba allows file sharing with Windows and other SMB clients, facilitating cross-platform access in a mixed OS environment. Guest share provides easy public access for shared files. WSDD ensures visibility in Windows networks. This supports file sharing needs in the homelab, such as media or document access from various devices."}
