{"path": "modifier_imports/zram.nix", "analysis": "This module configures zramSwap for compressed RAM-based swap space, optimizing memory usage on devices with limited RAM. It enables zram with zstd algorithm, sets memoryPercent to 100 for dynamic sizing based on RAM, and assigns a high priority to prefer it over disk swap. Notes: zramSwap.enable activates the zram swap functionality. Algorithm zstd provides efficient compression for better performance. memoryPercent 100 allows zram to use up to 100% of available RAM for swap, but dynamically. Priority 100 ensures zram swap is used before other swap devices. Reasoning: On low-RAM devices like Raspberry Pis, zram provides fast compressed swap in RAM rather than slower disk swap, improving performance and reducing wear on storage. This is particularly useful for embedded systems or memory-constrained machines in the homelab setup, as indicated by the comment about adjusting for Pi's RAM."}
