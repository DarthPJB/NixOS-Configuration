{"path": "environments/tools.nix", "purpose": "Provides essential command-line tools for system administration and basic usage.", "key_options": [], "imports": [], "exports": ["environment.systemPackages"], "dependencies": ["btop", "nano", "wget", "git", "ranger", "killall", "magic-wormhole", "dnsutils", "pciutils", "lshw", "usbutils"], "nixos_patterns": ["environment.systemPackages"], "integration_points": ["Adds basic utilities to system packages"], "notes": "This module installs a curated set of command-line tools that are commonly needed for monitoring system performance (btop), text editing (nano), downloading files (wget), version control (git), file browsing (ranger), process management (killall), secure file transfer (magic-wormhole), network diagnostics (dnsutils), hardware inspection (pciutils, lshw, usbutils). These tools enhance the usability of NixOS systems by providing standard utilities without requiring manual installation.", "reasoning": "In a NixOS environment, where the base system is minimal, providing these essential tools ensures that users have immediate access to fundamental utilities for system interaction, troubleshooting, and development. The selection balances utility with minimalism, avoiding bloated packages while covering core needs. This module follows NixOS conventions by using environment.systemPackages for declarative package management."}
