{"path": "users/deployment.nix", "analysis": "This module creates a deployment user account with limited sudo privileges for automated deployment tasks, using the same SSH public key as the main user. It grants NOPASSWD sudo for all commands, intended for CI/CD or deployment scripts. Notes: User deploy with uid 1110, home /tmp/deploy, authorized keys from master pub key. Extra groups wheel. Security.sudo.extraRules allows ALL commands NOPASSWD for deploy user. Reasoning: Enables secure, automated deployments without exposing full administrative credentials. Shared SSH key allows key-based authentication from deployment systems. Broad sudo access is acceptable since it requires the private key, providing a balance of automation and security. Useful for nixinate or similar deployment tools in the NixOS ecosystem."}
