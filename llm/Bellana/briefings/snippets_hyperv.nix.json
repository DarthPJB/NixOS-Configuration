{"path": "snippets/hyperv.nix", "analysis": "This is a generated NixOS hardware configuration for a Hyper-V virtual machine named TerminalVM2, with systemd-boot EFI loader, NTFS support, and basic networking setup. It defines file systems, swap, and enables Hyper-V guest integration. Notes: Boot loader systemd-boot with EFI support. Supported filesystems include NTFS. Networking uses DHCP false, hostname TerminalVM2. Hardware CPU AMD with microcode. Virtualisation.hypervGuest enabled. File systems by label for / and /boot, swap by label. Reasoning: This configuration allows NixOS to run as a guest in Hyper-V, providing virtualization support for Windows hosts. EFI boot ensures modern firmware compatibility. NTFS support enables access to Windows shared storage. Basic setup provides a functional VM for development or testing purposes."}
