{"path": "services/github_runners.nix", "analysis": "This module configures GitHub Actions self-hosted runners for the repository DarthPJB/parsec-gaming-nix, using a specific runner token from secrix secrets. It sets up a runner named 'disgust' with the provided URL and token file. Notes: Services.github-runners.disgust enabled with name, tokenFile from secrix decrypted path, and GitHub URL. Secrix service for the token. Reasoning: Self-hosted runners provide custom execution environments for CI/CD pipelines, offering more control and resources than GitHub's hosted runners. This allows running builds and tests on NixOS infrastructure, potentially with specific hardware or software setups. Useful for projects requiring Nix or specialized tooling."}
