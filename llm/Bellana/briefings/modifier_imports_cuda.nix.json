{"path": "modifier_imports/cuda.nix", "sanitized_path": "modifier_imports_cuda.nix.json", "notes": "This module enables CUDA support for NVIDIA GPUs, including monitoring and software packages. It opens firewall port 3103 for NVIDIA GPU Prometheus exporter on the WireGuard interface, enables the exporter service. System packages include nvtop for monitoring, CUDA toolkit, CUDA-enabled versions of llama-cpp, colmap, and blender. Nixpkgs configuration enables CUDA and cuDNN support, with permitted insecure packages commented.", "reasoning": "The configuration facilitates GPU-accelerated computing for machine learning (llama-cpp), photogrammetry (colmap), and 3D rendering (blender). Prometheus integration allows metrics collection for GPU performance. Firewall rules ensure exporter access only via VPN. This module is essential for systems with NVIDIA GPUs intended for compute workloads."}
