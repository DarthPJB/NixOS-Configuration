{"path": "machines/remote-worker/default.nix", "sanitized_path": "machines_remote-worker_default.nix.json", "notes": "This NixOS configuration defines a remote worker machine hosting Nextcloud for file sharing and web services. Imports include base configuration, Tailscale for mesh networking, Nextcloud service, build user, dynamic DNS with Gandi, WireGuard VPN, and ACME certificate management for 'johnbargman.net' and 'johnbargman.com' domains with wildcard subdomains. Nginx is configured with virtual hosts for HTTPS redirects, default denial, and static file serving from the webroot directory. VPN is enabled with postfix 50, hostname 'remote-worker', and unique host ID.", "reasoning": "The configuration establishes a secure, internet-facing server for cloud storage and web hosting, leveraging ACME for automated SSL certificates, Tailscale for private networking, and Nginx for efficient HTTP handling. WireGuard integration provides VPN access, while dynamic DNS ensures domain resolution. The setup prioritizes security and accessibility for remote file and web service operations."}
