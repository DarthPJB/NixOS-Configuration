{"path": "services/dynamic_domain_gandi.nix", "analysis": "This module implements dynamic DNS updates for Gandi-hosted domains, periodically updating A records with the current external IP address using the Gandi LiveDNS API. It uses systemd timers and services for automated execution, with secrets managed via secrix. Notes: Timer runs on boot after 5m and every 60m. Service script fetches external IP, gets zone href, and PUTs A record update. Uses API key from secrix secret. Domain and subdomain from config. Reasoning: Dynamic DNS allows remote access to machines with changing IP addresses. Gandi API integration provides programmatic DNS management. Periodic updates ensure DNS records stay current. This supports homelab access from external networks, enabling services like SSH or web interfaces."}
