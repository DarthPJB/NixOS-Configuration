{"path": "public_key/flake.nix", "analysis": "This flake.nix defines SSH public keys for the domain johnbargman.net, using the keyFlake library to manage authorized keys for users. It imports keyFlake and uses mkKeyFlake to configure keys for the user John88 on the specified domain. Notes: The inputs section pulls keyFlake from GitHub. Outputs use let-in to define mkKeyFlake application, configuring domain records with user keys read from id_ed25519_master.pub. Reasoning: This provides centralized SSH key management for the domain, ensuring secure access to systems. By using a flake for key distribution, it allows declarative management of authorized keys across multiple machines, which is essential for automated deployment and security in a multi-machine NixOS infrastructure."}
