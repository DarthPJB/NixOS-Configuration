{"path": "server_services/hedgedoc.nix", "analysis": "This module sets up HedgeDoc, a real-time collaborative markdown editor, with Nginx reverse proxy and SSL termination. It configures Nginx to proxy requests to the local HedgeDoc service on port 3333, enables ACME for SSL certificates, and sets up the HedgeDoc service with SQLite database and domain configuration. Notes: Nginx is configured with recommended proxy and TLS settings, and virtual host for hedgedoc.johnbargman.com with forceSSL and ACME. Locations block proxies / to localhost:3333 and /socket.io/ with WebSocket support. HedgeDoc settings include SQLite DB, domain, port, and protocol settings for secure operation. Reasoning: HedgeDoc provides collaborative editing capabilities, useful for note-taking and documentation in a server environment. The reverse proxy setup with SSL ensures secure access over HTTPS, while WebSocket support enables real-time collaboration features. This service enhances the homelab's productivity tools."}
