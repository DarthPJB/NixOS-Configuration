{"filename": "modifier_imports/hosts.nix", "path": "modifier_imports/hosts.nix", "function_summary": "Adds custom host mappings to /etc/hosts for network resolution.", "detailed_notes": "This configuration module extends the system's hosts file with additional IP-to-hostname mappings, facilitating direct network resolution for specific services and machines. The entries include various production and development endpoints, suggesting a distributed infrastructure setup. Notable mappings include production servers (forme.prod), remote workers, and multiple platonic network addresses, indicating a complex network topology with dedicated hostnames for different services. The implementation uses networking.extraHosts to append these entries to the standard /etc/hosts file. This approach provides DNS-like resolution without requiring a full DNS server, which is particularly useful for internal networks or development environments. The hardcoded IPs suggest static infrastructure or VPN-based connectivity, with hostnames following a pattern that indicates different service roles or locations within the network architecture."}
