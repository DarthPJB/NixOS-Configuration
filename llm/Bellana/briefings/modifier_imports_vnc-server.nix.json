{"filename": "modifier_imports/vnc-server.nix", "path": "modifier_imports/vnc-server.nix", "function_summary": "Sets up x11vnc service for remote desktop access via VNC.", "detailed_notes": "This module configures a VNC server using x11vnc, enabling remote graphical access to the system's X11 display. The systemd user service ensures the VNC server starts automatically with the graphical session, providing persistent remote access. The service is configured to restart automatically if it fails, ensuring reliability. The ExecStart command launches x11vnc with the current DISPLAY environment variable, allowing connections to the active X session. Environment variables DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY are passed through, enabling proper authentication and display access. This setup provides a lightweight remote desktop solution that integrates seamlessly with the system's display manager. While basic in configuration, it offers essential remote access functionality for administration and support purposes. The module demonstrates effective use of systemd user services for desktop applications, ensuring the VNC server operates within the user's context rather than system-wide."}
