{"path": "services/acme_server.nix", "analysis": "This module configures ACME (Let's Encrypt) certificate generation for a given FQDN using Gandi DNS provider, with automatic DNS-01 challenges. It sets up the acme group, accepts terms, and configures DNS propagation settings optimized for local DNS servers. Notes: Creates acme group. Security.acme.certs for the FQDN with extra domains option. Uses Gandi v5 DNS provider with environment file from secrix secret. Disables propagation check since local DNS. Reasoning: ACME provides free SSL certificates for secure HTTPS connections. DNS-01 challenges work with DNS providers like Gandi for wildcard certificates. Local DNS setup allows faster validation without waiting for propagation. This enables automated certificate management for services requiring SSL/TLS encryption."}
