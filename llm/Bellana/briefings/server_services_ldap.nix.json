{"path": "server_services/ldap.nix", "analysis": "This module configures OpenLDAP server with secure LDAPS connections, ACME SSL certificates, and access controls for user authentication in the domain dc=johnbargman,dc=net. It sets up the LDAP database with MDB backend, configures TLS certificates from ACME, and defines access rules for password and general data protection. Notes: Firewall allows LDAPS on port 636. OpenLDAP uses LDAPS URLs, with settings for cipher suites, certificate paths, and verification. Database configuration includes schema includes for standard LDAP schemas, root DN and password from secrets, and access controls allowing self password changes and read access for others. Systemd ensures LDAP starts after certificate generation. Reasoning: LDAP provides centralized user authentication and directory services, essential for multi-user systems and services requiring user management. Secure LDAPS with ACME certificates ensures encrypted communication. Access controls balance security with usability, allowing password management while protecting sensitive data. This supports enterprise-like user management in the homelab."}
