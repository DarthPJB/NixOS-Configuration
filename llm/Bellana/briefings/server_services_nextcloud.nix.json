{"path": "server_services/nextcloud.nix", "analysis": "This module configures Nextcloud, a self-hosted file sharing and collaboration platform, with S3 object storage backend, Redis caching, and Nginx reverse proxy with SSL. It sets up secrets for admin password and S3 keys, enables various preview providers, and configures multiple domain redirects. Notes: Nextcloud uses SQLite DB, admin password from secret, S3 backend on Backblaze B2 with credentials from secrets. Max upload size 50G, imagemagick enabled. Nginx virtual hosts for nextcloud.johnbargman.net and .com with SSL and redirects. Reasoning: Nextcloud offers cloud storage features like file sync, sharing, and collaboration tools. S3 backend offloads storage to cheap cloud storage, reducing local disk usage. Redis improves performance. Multiple domains and SSL ensure secure, accessible service. This provides personal cloud functionality in the homelab, replacing commercial services."}
