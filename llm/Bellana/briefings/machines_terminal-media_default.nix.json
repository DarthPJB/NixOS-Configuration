{"path": "machines/terminal-media/default.nix", "sanitized_path": "machines_terminal-media_default.nix.json", "notes": "This NixOS configuration appears mislabeled as 'terminal-media' but defines a machine named 'terminal-nx-01' for media processing. It imports CUDA support, WireGuard VPN, network locales, browsers, i3wm variant, code environment, and base configuration. VPN uses postfix 21 with Secrix secrets. System packages include Google Chrome, Brave, and Moonlight-QT for remote gaming. A user service auto-starts Google Chrome. Boot uses systemd-boot with EFI. Networking allows UDP port 2108, disables DHCP globally but enables on specific interfaces, enables wireless with user control. Hardware enables graphics, NVIDIA modesetting, libinput, X server with NVIDIA drivers, printing. NVIDIA configuration uses legacy 470 drivers with Prime sync for Intel/NVIDIA hybrid graphics. Pipewire handles audio. Boot modules include USB and storage drivers. File systems are ext4 for root and VFAT for boot, with swap.", "reasoning": "The configuration supports GPU-accelerated media tasks, remote desktop streaming via Moonlight, web browsing, and development, with wireless networking flexibility. NVIDIA Prime setup allows switching between integrated and discrete GPUs. Imported CUDA enables compute workloads, while i3wm provides a lightweight desktop environment."}
