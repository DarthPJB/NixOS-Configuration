{"filename": "modifier_imports/virtualisation-virtualbox.nix", "path": "modifier_imports/virtualisation-virtualbox.nix", "function_summary": "Enables VirtualBox virtualization with host extensions and user permissions.", "detailed_notes": "This module activates Oracle VirtualBox as a virtualization platform on the host system. It enables the VirtualBox host service, which allows running virtual machines with hardware-assisted virtualization. The configuration adds the user 'John88' to the vboxusers group, granting necessary permissions for USB device passthrough and other host hardware access. The VirtualBox Extension Pack is enabled, providing additional features such as USB 2.0/3.0 support, host webcam passthrough, and RDP connectivity. This setup creates a user-friendly virtualization environment suitable for running Windows or other operating systems alongside NixOS. The module ensures proper user permissions and extended functionality, making VirtualBox a viable alternative to libvirt/QEMU for users preferring a graphical virtualization management interface. The configuration balances ease of use with the security considerations of running virtualization software."}
