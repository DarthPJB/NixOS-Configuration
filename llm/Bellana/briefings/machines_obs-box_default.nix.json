{"path": "machines/obs-box/default.nix", "sanitized_path": "machines_obs-box_default.nix.json", "notes": "This NixOS machine configuration defines settings for a system named 'obs-box', optimized for video streaming and recording using OBS Studio. Key features include automatic startup of OBS Studio and an X11 VNC server for remote access, NVIDIA GPU support with legacy drivers for hardware acceleration, i3 window manager with auto-login for the 'commander' user, Syncthing for file synchronization accessible via web GUI on port 8080, Pipewire audio system, SSH access on ports 1108 and 22, firewall allowances for relevant ports, ZFS pool integration, and security configurations allowing passwordless sudo for wheel users. The system disables screensaver and DPMS to prevent interruptions during streaming.", "reasoning": "The configuration is structured to support headless or remote operation of a streaming workstation, prioritizing GPU performance for video processing, secure remote access via SSH and VNC, file syncing capabilities, and audio handling. Imports are minimal, focusing on hardware-specific settings, with user services ensuring OBS and VNC start automatically upon graphical session initiation. Networking is configured for DHCP on multiple interfaces, with a unique host ID for ZFS compatibility."}
