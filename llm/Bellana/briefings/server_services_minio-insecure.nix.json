{"path": "server_services/minio-insecure.nix", "analysis": "This module sets up MinIO object storage server with browser disabled for security, configured on a specific address and port within the WireGuard VPN. It uses encrypted root credentials from secrix and stores data on local bulk storage. Notes: MinIO is configured with region 'homelab', browser disabled, listenAddress and consoleAddress on host 10.88.127.3 ports 2222 and 2223. Data directory is /bulk-storage/minio. Root credentials decrypted from secrix secret. Firewall opened on wireg0 for the ports. Reasoning: MinIO provides S3-compatible object storage for the homelab, allowing file storage and sharing within the private network. Disabling browser enhances security by preventing web access. VPN-only access ensures data remains private. This supports backup, media storage, or application data needs in a secure, scalable manner."}
