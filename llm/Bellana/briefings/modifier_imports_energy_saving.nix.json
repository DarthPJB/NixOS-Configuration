{"filename": "modifier_imports/energy_saving.nix", "path": "modifier_imports/energy_saving.nix", "function_summary": "Configures power management settings for energy efficiency, including HDD spindown and CPU governor.", "detailed_notes": "This NixOS module focuses on optimizing system power consumption through targeted configurations. The primary components include udev rules that apply hdparm settings to rotational hard drives (excluding USB devices) to set advanced power management level 90 and spindown timeout, promoting energy savings for storage devices. Additionally, it sets the CPU frequency governor to 'ondemand' for dynamic scaling, enables general power management, and explicitly disables powertop service. The implementation uses functional programming patterns with mkRule and mkRules helper functions to construct udev rules declaratively, ensuring clean and maintainable code. This module is particularly relevant for systems with mechanical storage and variable workloads, balancing performance with energy efficiency without compromising system stability."}
